Redis Memory Configuration:
bash
CopyEdit
redis-cli INFO memory
Ensure sufficient memory is available and no eviction policies (like allkeys-lru) are causing data to be removed.
Redis Eviction Policy:
Verify the maxmemory-policy setting. Use:
bash
CopyEdit
redis-cli CONFIG GET maxmemory-policy
Ideally, this should be set to noeviction if Redis is dedicated to BullMQ.
